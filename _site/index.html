  <div><p>Well, this is shaping up nicely. I have two types of post, <code>blog</code> and <code>post</code>, for long and short text posts respectively, rendering with their own styles. I saw a page on 11ty's site describing how to do excerpts, which I think will be nice for the blog posts. Soon there will be need for pagination, if I keep up these little blogs.</p>
<p>The next step will be to hook up the CMS and figure out hosting. Less fun for me than this part, but necessary.</p>
<p>I don't think these individual markdown files for each post will scale. I initially thought of the posts as objects in a JSON file, which also (I'm pretty sure???) could port to a NoSQL DB pretty easily if I wanted, but the 11ty tutorials all had markdown files at first. Something to think about after the CMS is up and running.</p>
<p>I'm also imagining hiring a freelance designer to do designs for this, and also maybe for my homepage that hasn't seen an update in 10ish years. I'll have to set aside some budget for that, but would be nicer than trying to do it myself.</p>

  <p><p>so far, when I think I'm struggling with 11ty, what I'm actually dealing with is a lack of templating (Nunjucks) knowledge</p>

  <div><p>As I was falling alseep last night, I realized that I should blog the experience of creating this app as I go. A nice meta touch.</p>
<p>A lot of my thoughts so far are in the README. I know I need to grok how 11ty organizes data and posts next before I go making changes. All of the tutorials show how to make an index page that links to the individual posts, so I should probably follow that before trying to make a wholly rendered &quot;stream&quot; view. I also wonder how I will be able to render different post &quot;types&quot;. Trying to remember to walk before I attempt to run. It's difficult when you know what the end result should look like but you haven't seen what the pieces look like or how they fit together yet.</p>
