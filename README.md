# Stream

A small river. Personal replacement for Twitter. A central place for me to dump thoughts, photos, shitposts, share other social media posts, and whatever else I want to use it for.

## Name ideas
This is important.

### Greek inspired
- Limni (ŒªŒØŒºŒΩŒπ): Greek for "lake"
- Revma (œÅŒµœçŒºŒ±): Greek for "stream"
- Rema (œÅŒ≠ŒºŒ±): Greek for "stream"
- Ryaki (œÅœÖŒ¨Œ∫Œπ): Greek for "little river", "brook"
- Potamos (œÄŒøœÑŒ±ŒºœåœÇ): Greek for "river", "waterway", "stream"

### English
- Brook
- Creek
- Stream

## Brainstorming
### Ideas
Content in a stream, not really a blog. Must be easy to make posts, not just from a computer, but by mobile phone too. Build a web interface (idk so much work)? Post via Slack? CMS?

Should eventually contain the archive of my old tweets (see Darius Kazemi's [Twitter archive processor output for inspiration](https://tinysubversions.com/twitter-archive/make-your-own/)). Posts will be searchable. There will be an RSS feed and have meta snippets that look nice when links are shared in Slack.

Technology should be as close to plain fundamental web technologies as possible. Static site generation, as little JS as possible. No CSS preprocessor (How will it be to build a site from bottom-up with plain CSS in 2023? What are the best practices and how to keep it organized?). Semantic markup, HTML where possible. Accessibility core to site (alt text for all images, also alt text for ASCII or emoji art posts). No tracking. Responsive, minimal design.

### Random thoughts
Trying to not use too many new-to-me things, so since 11ty is new, it seems prudent to start off using a templating feature that 11ty uses by default. This appears to be Nunjucks, but WebC looks compelling, so I should check it out after I'm feeling a bit more comfortable with 11ty.

#### Basic post types
- Small text (tweet-length) with links
- Long text (with formatting?)
- Single image post
- Multiple-image posts

#### Extended post types
- media I consumed: book, video game, movie, etc.
- eBird list
- "RT"/"QT" tweets, mastodon posts, other social sites

### Features
- Store posts
  - Host? GitHub Pages, Netlify, other? How about images?
- Display posts
  - Stream view
  - Individual view with permalinks for individual posts
  - Dark mode and light mode
- Upload posts
  - Off the shelf CMS (Netlify CMS, or another headless CMS?) or hand-rolled? I probably don't want to spend time doing this.
- Publish RSS feed
