Having a real struggle with getting permalink views to work. When I add additional markup to the post templates, it shows up on the homepage in the stream view. I can't figure out how to exclude markup that I don't want from views it shouldn't show up on.

I did add a nice background gradient, and the homepage isn't looking half bad. Though I tried to add an env variable and to change the background color on dev or prod, but it's not working correctly and prod has the orangey background intended for dev.

Probably what I get for developing while half-watching the old Lupin the Third series from the beginning ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
