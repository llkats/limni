layout: "blog"

As I was falling alseep last night, I realized that I should blog the experience of creating this app as I go. A nice meta touch.

A lot of my thoughts so far are in the README. I know I need to grok how 11ty organizes data and posts next before I go making changes. All of the tutorials show how to make an index page that links to the individual posts, so I should probably follow that before trying to make a wholly rendered "stream" view. I also wonder how I will be able to render different post "types". Trying to remember to walk before I attempt to run. It's difficult when you know what the end result should look like but you haven't seen what the pieces look like or how they fit together yet.
