layout: "blog"
title: "update"

Well, this is shaping up nicely. I have two types of post, `blog` and `post`, for long and short text posts respectively, rendering with their own styles. I saw a page on 11ty's site describing how to do excerpts, which I think will be nice for the blog posts. Soon there will be need for pagination, if I keep up these little blogs.

The next step will be to hook up the CMS and figure out hosting. Less fun for me than this part, but necessary.

I don't think these individual markdown files for each post will scale. I initially thought of the posts as objects in a JSON file, which also (I'm pretty sure???) could port to a NoSQL DB pretty easily if I wanted, but the 11ty tutorials all had markdown files at first. Something to think about after the CMS is up and running.

I'm also imagining hiring a freelance designer to do designs for this, and also maybe for my homepage that hasn't seen an update in 10ish years. I'll have to set aside some budget for that, but would be nicer than trying to do it myself.
