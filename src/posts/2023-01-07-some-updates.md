Added Noto Sans as a font. I chose it mostly because it seems popular and looks fine to read on a screen and also I like how Greek looks in it (και ίσως θέλω να γράψω κάτι στα ελλήνικα).

Also installed DayJS, the tiny date library, and cleaned up the timestamps, which are looking a lot more readable now.

Briefly installed eslint and then uninstalled it after realizing I have ~20 lines of handwritten JS. How refreshing! I'm not going to bother with a style linter for that little JavaScript.

The most important thing for this project will be to leave myself todos and notes. Every time I pick this project up, I'm assuming I will have forgotten what I intended to do. Next up should probably be pagination, followed by extending post types. I left the todos list in the README in the project repo, in case you forgot that too, future llkats.
