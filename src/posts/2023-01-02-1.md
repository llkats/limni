Well, I did it. The CMS is hooked up, and it works! This is very exciting. If I'd known what I was doing from the start, this would've taken an afternoon. If I'd had the focus, it might've taken a day, with following along with various tutorials. As it is, I'm pleased with my progress, and hopeful that I continue picking away at it.

My goal right now is to find a nicer way of declaring different types of posts. It seems that the general assumption, in both 11ty and in Netlify CMS is that one would make one kind of formatted post type for a single collection, but I want many posts that can have different layouts and be collated into a single stream. How do I loop over all of the posts and have them render via the layout specified in the front matter?

I also need to add titles, because the Netlify CMS appears to depend on them. I only want blog posts to have titles so far, but I suppose I can just hide them in the short post template.

This is the fun part.
