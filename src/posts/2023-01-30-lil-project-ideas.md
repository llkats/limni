Every time I see the nullish coalescing operator (`??`), I think, 1. what a cool name, and 2. how does this work again?

I want to make a little site that would present variables in different expressions incoming  and ask what the expression evaluates to, similar to arithmetic drills. I think it would help gain "at a glance" fluency with this cool-named operator.
